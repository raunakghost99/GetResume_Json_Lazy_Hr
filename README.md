# AWS Cloud Resume API

This project is for the cloud resume challenge api and this readme  will guide you through building and deploying a serverless API using AWS Lambda and DynamoDB, integrated with GitHub Actions and Terraform .


## Overview

This project automates the deployment of all infrastructure using terraform runnign on GitHub Actions. The Lambda function serves as the backend for a resume API, providing endpoints via api gateway to fetch resume details stored in a dynamoDB table .

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](./diagram.png)

The architecture involves:

- **AWS Lambda**: Runs the backend code for the API but can be used for any purpose like a temporary compute.
- **AWS API Gateway**: Provides a RESTful API endpoint connectds it to whatever backend required in this case a lambda function.
- **DynamoDB**: Stores the resume data in json format.
- **Terraform**: Creates the infrastructure using code when ran through either github actions or just a computer.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates the CI/CD pipeline which may include running terraform code as in this case or running test cases as well it acts as as a computer/instance on a cloud.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- An AWS account with necessary permissions.
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed.
- A GitHub account with access to the repository and a workflow in yaml which also has acess to the aws credentials stored as secrets.


### Project setup steps ðŸš€

#### 1. Set Up AWS

- **Sign Up for AWS**: If you don't already have an AWS account, sign up at [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/).
- **Set Up Credentials**: Configure your AWS CLI with your credentials using `aws configure`.

#### 2. Create a JSON Resume

- Create a JSON file containing your resume data. Follow a schema [Here](https://jsonresume.org/schema)
- Store as json format to give it to the post function through either postman or any other tool 

#### 3. Create Terraform Configuration

- Create `main.tf` and `provider.tf` for infrastructure as code as a way to automatically create the lambda function and the API Gateway configurations .

#### 4. Set Up GitHub Actions

- Create a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/terraform.yml`) to automatically deploy infrastructure to your aws cloud on every push to the repository.Also put your aws keys and secrets in github to deploy the infrastructure.

#### 5. Test the API

- **API Gateway URL**: Test your endpoint to ensure it returns the resume data in JSON format (the one generated after executing the terraform setup) using `curl`.
- **GitHub Actions**: Make a change to your code, push to the repository, and verify that the GitHub Actions workflow deploys the updated Lambda function.
